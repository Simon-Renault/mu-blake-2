    Cineplastic stroll proposed within temporarily invested hotel rooms. The imagery of the cinema is
    marked by many iconic places that have lastingly marked its history and ours — the hotels are
    among these most mythical platforms in the sense of Barthésien, visible through such films as The
    Last Men by Friedrich-Wilhelm Murnau , Marcel Carné's Northern Hotel, Alfred Hitchcock's
    Psycho, Alain Resnais's Last Year at Marienbad, Ingmar Bergman's Silence, Alice in the Cities of
    Wim Wenders, Chantal Akerman's Anna's Appointments , Nostalghia by Andrey Tarkovsky,
    Mala Noche by Gus Van Sant, David Lynch's Twin Peaks, 2046 by Wong Kar-wai, and Tomita
    Katsuya's recent Bangkok Nites — all of which depict the figure of the hotel in all its forms, all the
    times and according to the comings and goings of a gallery of very singular characters, often in
    prey or in search of solitude, introspection.

    This project focus on the question of looking at what "makes film" — to live it simultaneously, to
    immerse itself in its material, a cinephile word — then to observe what constitutes it plastically in
    its contextualized forms except "white cube", where the creations can incarnate otherwise. The
    long corridors of the hotel invite to wander in what is left in the cinema when you remove the
    experience of the projection to give to see the anatomy — a constellation in "split screen",
    polyvisual or polyptych, of this what is the "totality" of the seventh of the arts. This navigation
    progressively unveil a scripted archipelago, visual and performed in which come to incarnate
    several characters, concepts, objects, images and words : the search for a cinematics.

        Malraux says something very simple about art, he says "it's the only thing that resists
    death." [...] Any act of resistance is not a work of art although, in some way it is. Every work
    of art is not an act of resistance and yet, in a way, it is.
