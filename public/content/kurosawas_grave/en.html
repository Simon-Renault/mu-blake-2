<h1>Kurosawa's grave</h1> 
<p>Kamakura, Japan. In Search of the grave of the emperor of cinema — of a spiritual
    encounter that has been waiting for years — it's in the middle of a partially destroyed
    cemetery that the confluence quickly takes cinematographic paces. The spirits wake
    up and tell, from the vestiges of the place, how remains the myth of the virtuoso
    director, having escaped from a natural disaster. All the elements of the cemetery
    manifest themselves in turn, fueling the desire to make this movie scene of
    recollection a real film set, including the cinematterial keys of reading which are
    already present — pending, as left in evidence by the deformations of time and space.</p>
