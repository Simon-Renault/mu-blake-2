<h1>SPLIT SCREEN & GIF</h1> 
<p>Fleeting set of island languages, the GIF is a fragmentary and fragmented excerpt
    from the real world. Its punctual shapes are constantly thwarted by the minute loop
    of time. The experiences of this mode of reading change diametrically our relation to
    narration, then to the consent that is usually or not accorded to movement and
    duration. Beyond its scale and its virtual exploitation, the GIF is a format allowing a
    semantic compression, which one acquires and that one receives instantly. This
    spatio-temporal loop has emerged through the practice of filmmakers such as Chris
    Marker and Alain Resnais — experimenting with back-and-forth screenings, multiple
    and repeated interpretations at the same time or in identical places : reversals that
    apply throughout the entire scope of a work. It is a question of understanding what
    the uncertain repetition of an equivalent and fugitive action means today. The GIF
    format would thus be a leitmotiv in which the responsibility to fail is assumed, to
    never reach anywhere — except in a constant, almost maniacal re-creation. On the
    ultimate film set, in the heart of a set of superimposed layers : the vision vanishes
    and reborns, a retinal persistence whose casual attitude is in the grip of renunciation
    — it imprints its mark on our eyes.</p>
