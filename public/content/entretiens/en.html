<p>
    The interviews are intended to shed light on ideas related to Matthieu Blake's
research, concerning in the first place the relationship between cinema and the visual
arts. It is a matter of clearly evoking questions that explore and induce the polyvision
and the cinematter. These meetings and testimonies come from the world of theory,
artistic practice, literature or cinema and are part of the extension of his creations.
These cross-views offer a critical and historical vision of a creative knowledge by
taking Elie Faure and his concept of "cin√©plastique" as a starting point.
