<h1>Devant L'archipel</h1>
<h2>Nocturne bibliothéque</h2>

<p>
    Development and curation of a momentary situation at the Library of the Fine Arts in
Nantes — with the participation of Melissa Cascade, Jonathan Douis, Jiyoon Jang, Rie
Konishi, Corentin Louis, Erwan Martinerie & Sebastien Boucle, Louise Masson,
Sebastien Piron and Juliette Thomas.
From one of the sources of language to an atlas of widespread images, the library has
constantly nurtured ideas. Creative minds come to draw from unsuspected forms and possibilities. From the cinematic idea of “split-screen” characteristic of a multi-
image or “polyvision” to an approach of arts and languages in constellation, this event proposes a set of malfunctions infiltrated provisionally in this established order.
Guest artists cultivate a singular relationship with words and pages, insularity, flow
of images, sound, cinema and editing; they seek to produce new reading modes
including multiple entry and exit points. These achievements sometimes come from
the collection, the compilation, or the forms of panoplies-archives. The library is
usually a place of study, content and preservation; its operation is close to what
Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari called the “rhizome” : a multicenter and
nonhierarchical system that continually extends. To think in a network, in a group of
archipelagos, is to think the plurality of exchanges as a multitude of deterroralising
and proliferating flows. It's about expressing a tree-like thinking, as a reticular, by a
system in which any point of a rhizome can be connected with any other, such as one can pass from a book to the other, from one title to another. This set of points is a
system of insularities, an irregular network of classified, concrete, similar or opposite
elements, abstract or forgotten — they allow us to better analyze the real.
