<h1>Shisha no sho - le livre des morts</h1>

<p>
    Collaboration project bringing together the OLTA collective and Matthieu Blake around the
cinematographic idea « in the process of being realized » — a film partially produced live
and whose scenario is unfolded by the performance, speech and drawing, in the style of
Kurosawa Akira's painted storyboards. The object of the film is gradually revealed, mentally,
it explores the history of the book Shisha no Sho 死者の書 by Orikuchi Shinobu, published in
1943. This major Japanese Gothic novel mixes ancient poetry with the Buddhist religion, the
figure of the ghost and the insane relationship of Otsu prince and Iratsume princess at the
time of Nara.

After having studied many documents about Orikuchi Shinobu's novel, each member of the
group focused his research on elements of the narrative with the aim of creating a
fragmentary literary creation that joins the others and contributes to the final scenario. The
group was also able to meet Ando Reiji — teacher-researcher and specialist of Orikuchi
Shinobu — then moved to many places described by the author in its history, including
Kamakura, Nara and Kyoto. As a result of this research time, the group decided to travel to
Nara, to the legendary Taima-dera Temple and to the Mount Futakami, the main places
depicted in Shisha no Sho 死者の書. The readings and performances take place outside the
white cube, specifically on Mount Futakami, thus renewing the chosen location with the
written history and its historical origins.

The members of the group wear kimonos with black obi on which the texts — bits of
scenarios created — are written in white ink. The kimono itself then becomes the medium of
writing and narrative — a page that marries each body and places it under seal, waiting to be
unfolded and read. These cinematerial poems are pronounced in turn by each member of the
group, at different crossing points of Mount Futakami : in front of a cave, in front of a temple,
on the path that leads to the top of the mountain. The person who reads is in the center and
declaims his cinepoetry, while the other performers draw live what is said according to their
interpretation. Transparent surfaces are arranged in front of them and represent what the
screen is in a kind of double reading, an opacity that allows multiple looks : first that of the
artist, who is also the director of the film simultaneously said and painted ; then the external
gaze of the discoverer or the passerby, who assists outside the circle of the group at the
realization, like a spectator placed in detachment (cf. Bertolt Brecht). These screens can also
change height, they are modular and portable structures, which recall the research of Dan
Graham on the multiplied vision of images and the idea of reflecting-screen.
<br>
<br>
Shisha no Sho 死者の書 offers a reflection on the process of film creation itself, about what
means to « make film » and to produce a « cinematographic gesture ». This documented
performance evokes the films Ran (1985) and Yume (1990) by Kurosawa Akira, which unveil
all the essence and the value of his work on the cinematographic absolute from the painting.
The elements transposed instantaneously into reality reconstitute the film whose mental
images are revealed step by step. The drawings succeed one another then are erased,
restarted, pursued ; the film thus remains engraved inside the landscape, forever infused
into the original space of the work itself, where it took root.
