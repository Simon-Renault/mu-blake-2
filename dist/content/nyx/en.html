<h1>NYX</h1> 
<p>
    The night can, from one moment to another, give way to fiction. It is a space of
fantasies and disappearance that evokes insecurity and nothingness in the collective
imagination ; however, romantic poets have also sung and extolled her for her
dreamlike power. The film presents a collection of video recordings that form a
repertoire of the nocturnal world, a composition without conventional narration
scenes whose sequences are piled up like stratas, in plateaux. The assembly of
recordings filmed at different times and places draws a sensitive and unachieved
portrait of the night — sometimes abstract, poetic or threatening. The project, started
in 2015, has no end. It aims to take the opposite of a conventional narrative film, that
is : a beginning, a duration, events, an epilogue. The filmic object continues to rise
over the years, by superimposing the memory layers of sound and image, like a
slippery surface evolving intuitively. The night thus remains a kind of organized
disorder which is familiar to us, as much as foreign — a territory where the forms are
concealing, as much that they reveal themselves. Documenting the night disrupts a

mute and indomitable equilibrium, from which we pulls the elements out of their
sleep — a sleep which, would we believe, could be eternal.
